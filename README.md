# For-a-diploma-1

Scripts For_diploma_script-collector (_, 3 and 4) parsed a collection of works of Russian literature distributed by genre in txt format. (about a 19320 works of 7 different genres)
The books were scraped off library site - https://ilibrary.ru and https://lib.ru/. 

Because of the hacky nature of the script (For_diploma_script-collector.py), there might be errors in the produced material, use at own risk! 

After that the collection has been compressed for balance. Now it is about 14000 works, about 1860-2050 works in each genre. All scripts for this also included.
